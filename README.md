Hello! And welcome to Cameron's super ~~secret~~ public SQL Portfolio. 

If you're new here, feel free to poke around. This **code repository** highlights some of the work I've done in **SQL.** 

While I haven't been active much on GitHub, I **have been** busy putting my skills to practice - with my primary focus on learning **Tableau.** I've also been creating and managing a private Database, with plans to release it publicly.

This site will be updated soon. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions or to simply drop a "Hi!"
